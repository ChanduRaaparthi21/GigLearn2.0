first we need to run below commands to install jenkins in vm or ubuntu :- JENKINS installation link :- https://varunmanik1.medium.com/devops-jenkins-aws-series-part-1-how-to-install-jenkins-on-aws-ubuntu-22-04-cb0c3cdb055

WE NEED TO RUN JDK TO CONTINUE WITH JENKINS
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get update          :- to update packages

sudo apt-get install jenkins : to install jenkins packages

sudo docker run -d -p 8080:8080 container name :- to map the port on our host( Our laptop for example), to the port on the container
sudo docker search jenkins                     :- to search jenkins image
sudo docker run -it imagename                  :- to run as container and into the container
sudo docker start containername                :- to start the container
sudo attach containername                      :- to enter into the container
cat /etc/os-release                          :- to check the current image when we're in container
sudo docker run -it --name changingname imagename :- to change the image name
sudo docker -it --name name imagename changing command :- to change the command
sudo docker run -it --name newcontainername imagename command(/bin/bash/) :- to create a container from image and changing its name and command and enterinto that container.
sudo docker commit containername newimagename    :- to build and create a new image 
sudo docker kill containername                   :- to kill the container

sudo docker rename oldcontainername newcontainername :- to rename  a container
sudo docker build -t newimagename .               :- to build and create a new image after created dcockerfile

FROM IMAGE 
VOLUME ["/vamsi"]                              :- to create a volume...

-------------------------ANSIBLE------------------------------
/etc/ansible/hosts                            :- to enter the nodes in ansible server interface so that we can add the nodes which we wanna configure
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config                      :- to anable the password authentication for ansiblesever
ssh-keygen                                    :- to generate ssh key
ansible all --lists-hosts                     :- to check all the nodes in the server
ansible groupname --lists-hosts               :- to check the nodes in a particular group

after that we need add anisble user in nodes as well and we need give root priveleges to that user..and enable the passwords athentication as well.

after that we need restart sshd in all the nodes along with ansible server with using this command (sudo systemctl restart sshd).

after that we need login as ansible user in all nodes as well anisible server.....later we need generate ssh key in ansible user in ansible server
